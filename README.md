# An implementation of NECSA on DrQ-v2, an episodic control-based method for solving continuous DMControl tasks with image-based states. 

- Please refer to the repo of DrQ-v2 for installation.

- We suggest using Ubuntu 20.04 with a complete installation of OpenGL since DrQ-v2 requires the OS render modules.

- Our thanks go to the DrQ-v2 authors since a vision-based augmentation for solving continuous DMControl tasks can benefit the DRL community. Please kindly cite the DrQ-v2 paper.

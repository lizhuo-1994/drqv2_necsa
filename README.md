# An implmenetation of NECSA on DrQ-v2, an episodic control-based method for solving continuous DMControl tasks with image-based states. Please refer to the repo of DrQ-v2 for installation.

# We suggest to use Ubuntu 20.04 with full installation of OpenGL since DrQ-v2 requires the OS render modules.
